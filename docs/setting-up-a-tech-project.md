Below is a step by step process for how a tech project can be set up

## 1. User-Requirements

The goal in this section is to create a list of user requirements. The user requirements will work as an interface (connection point) between tech and non-tech people.

### Understanding the users

What groups are you wanting to target? Old, young? Computer litarate or not?

### Research

What other applications or websites are out there that are similar to what you want to achieve?

### Brainstorming

Write down any ideas for features that pop into your head, talk with others in the organization and ask them to do the same

### Writing things down and prioritizing

It's useful to prioritize the requirements. These documents can be placed in a place where everyone can see them

Here is an example for a website:

Requirement | Priority
---|---
Donations | Essential
Newsletter signup | High
Forum | High
Accessability | Medium


## 2. Management

### Project Manager

This is a person that can provide more detailed requirements, handle logistics, etc. Ideally this is someone from your organization

Here are some things that the person with this role can do:
* Recruit volunteers
* Writing the business requirement
* Creating a draft for the user interface
* Follow up with volunteers
* etc

A dedicated volunteer might take over some of these tasks later on

### Tech Lead

* Interviews and picks candidates
* Can set up the technical programming environment for volunteers (GitHub, server infrastructure, etc)
* Be available for volunteers to answer tech questions (ideally once per day)
* Be able to handle challenging technical issues

This is an important person for the project. Because of the time commitment as well as tech knowledge it may be difficult to find this person. This person may be a paid person that you recruit, or a volunteer that you identify after the volunteer has spent one or two weeks in the project

### Volunteers

#### Putting up project ads for volunteers on Code4SocialGood

Please make sure to include the following: TBD

#### Reasonable Expectations

##### Experience

Some volunteers are experienced, many volunteers are new and want experience from working on a project

##### Commitment

Some volunteers may contribute a lot, many volunteers will make a contribution here and there. Unfortunately many volunteers will not be as dedicated as they seem at the beginning. It might take a few weeks before you can see if a volunteer is dedicated to the project

**Because of this it's recommended to accept many more volunteers than you need**

#### Gratitude

Please express gratitude towards the volunteers for contributing


## 3. Technical infrastructure

You may want help from a volunteer for this. If you know exactly what you need from the software you can asking for help here: https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/

### Version Control

Github

### Communication

#### Email lists

Google groups

#### Real time communication

You can use slack, gitter, or IRC

#### Issue management and project planning

Github has issues management, as well as "projects" and "milestones" for managing tasks and issues
