The code for the login page is not availble in any of the github repos, but is instead available in the control panel on auth0.com

To change the html:
1. Go to auth0.com
2. Log in (you will need to get login credentials)
3. If you want to change from the *prod* site to *dev* or *staging* you can click in the upper right corner and select "Switch Tenant"
4. In the menu panel to the left select "Hosted Pages"
5. Here you will find the custom html used for the production site, which is possible to edit right here (before editing make sure to save a backup copy first)
