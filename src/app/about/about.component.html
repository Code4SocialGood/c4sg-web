    <p>
      As a nonprofit, it can be hard to offer paid work. A limited budget means fewer workers, which in turn means work that cannot always be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Code for Social Good, we understand the struggle of nonprofit companies. And as a nonprofit company ourselves, we seek to provide other such organizations with the technical help they need-for no charge whatsoever.
