# Code for Social Good
Code for Social Good is a global platform to connet nonprofits and open source projects with tech volunteers. This project was initiated after the need for such a platform was realized from our own volunteering experiences. We are building this platform to address specific needs such as: 

#####Technical Volunteering
Most volunteer networks host opportunities that are generic in nature. There currently are a lack of accessible volunteering platforms that are aimed at the huge tech volunteering market, especially in the areas beyond the popular CMS website constructions.

#####Open Volunteering
Our platform is open to all non-profit organizations seeking technical volunteers and requires no screening on projects.
Our platform is open to all technical volunteers and requires no minimum experience level or commitment hours.

#####Junior Volunteering
Volunteering opportunities usually target individuals with significant experience (pro bono volunteers). Junior volunteers find it difficult to seek an opportunity to gain experience and grow into skilled volunteers. We hope to smooth this transition by encouraging team projects with senior professionals mentor junior developers.

The application is buit with the following architecture:
- Front End: Angular 2, CSS (Materialize CSS), HTML
- Back End: Java Spring Framework 
- Database: MySQL

We welcome technical volunteers to help build this platform. This project itself is a demonstration of our mission, that coders from anywhere, in any technical field, with any experience level, collaborating together on a project to help the nonprofits and also help each other grow.
